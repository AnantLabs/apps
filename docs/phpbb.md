## About PHPBB

Millions of people use **phpBB** on a daily basis, making it the most widely used open source bulletin board system in the world. Whether you want to stay in touch with a small group of friends or are looking to set up a large multi-category board for a corporate website, phpBB has the features you need built-in.

Newer users will appreciate phpBB's extensive administration panel, which allows the customisation of even the most intricate features without having to edit code directly while advanced users will value the ease with which phpBB can be integrated into existing systems.

Because phpBB is released under the [GNU General Public License](http://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.php), you may make changes to the code without first having to obtain permission from the phpBB Group. The [extensive database of user-created modifications](https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/modifications-1) makes changing and adding features as simple as pasting code into the appropriate files, while the [styles database](https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/styles-2) contains hundreds of style and image packages to customise your board.

The detailed [documentation](https://www.phpbb.com/support/documentation/) and [Flash video tutorials](https://www.phpbb.com/support/tutorials/) available on this site will help you get phpBB running on your server in minutes.
