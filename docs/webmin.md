## About Webmin

Webmin is a web-based interface for system administration for Unix. 
Using any modern web browser, you can setup user accounts, Apache, DNS, file sharing and much more

---

## Usage

Webmin is running on port 10000 by default. 
To access webmin just go to https://terminalservername.terminal.com and login with root credentials.

### Credentails:

- User: root
- Password: t3rminal



### **Important Note:**

The first time you login webmin (immediately after login) it will lead you to a blank screen at https://terminalservername-1000.terminal.com:10000. 
This is due a webmin harcoded redirection. To bypass that issue, just press "back" in your browser or refresh you browser before it happens.
