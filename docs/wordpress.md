## About WordPress

[WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) is web software you can use to create a beautiful website or blog.

The core software is built by hundreds of community volunteers and when you’re ready for more there are [thousands of plugins](http://wordpress.org/plugins/) and [themes](http://wordpress.org/themes/) available to transform your site into almost [anything you can imagine](http://wordpress.org/showcase/). Over 60 million people have chosen WordPress to power the place on the web they call “home” — we’d love you to join the family.
