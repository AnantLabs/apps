## About Magento
**Magento Community Edition** is open source software used to power your online store. Developers can modify the core code and add features and functionality by installing extensions from the [Magento Connect](http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect) marketplace.

Businesses using Community Edition as their open source ecommerce solution to run their stores will want to have access to their own Magento experts, since Magento does not provide technical support for this software. Answers to many technical questions are available on the community [user forum](http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards). Our open source community is growing and engaged to help support running your online store.

*Magento supports a Web template system which generates multiple similar-looking pages and customizes them.*

- **Themes** - Magento provides a basic theme which sets up an ecommerce website. The theme is designed for customizing all pages by adding or editing the PHP, HTML and CSS. Magento users may install themes which change the display of the website or its functionality. Without loss of content or layout of pages, themes are interchangeable with Magento installations. Themes are installed by uploading theme folders via FTP or SSH and applying them using the backend admin system.

- **Modules** - Magento developers have created Magento plugins which extend its basic built-in functionality. Magento users can install modules by downloading them, and uploading them to their server, or applying a module's Extension Key through Magento Connect Manager.
