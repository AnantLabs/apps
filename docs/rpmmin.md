# Centos 6.5 with Webmin - Terminal.com Container
*Official Centos 6.5 distribution with minimal stack for running Terminal.com IDE and Webmin web administration tool.*

   
## Usage:
Webmin is running on port 10000 by default.
To access webmin just go to https://terminalservername-1000.terminal.com and login with root credentials.

### Default credentials
- user: root
- password: t3rminal

### Important Note:
The first time you login webmin (immediately after login) it will lead you to a blank screen at https://terminalservername-1000.terminal.com:10000. This is due a webmin harcoded redirection. To bypass that issue, just press "back" in your browser or refresh you browser before it happens.
