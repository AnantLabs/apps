# **Mesos Master Node** Terminal.com Snapshot

*Program against a cluster like itâ€™s a single pool of resources.*

## About Mesos

**Apache Mesos** abstracts CPU, memory, storage and other resources away from machines (physical or virtual). It enables fault-tolerant and elastic distributed systems to be easily built and run effectively.

Mesos is built using the same principles as the Linux kernel, only at a different level of abstraction. The Mesos kernel runs on every machine and provides applications (e.g. Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, Elastic Search) with APIs for resource management and scheduling across entire datacenter and cloud environments.

## Key Features

- Scales up to 10,000s of nodes.
- Fault-tolerant replicated master and slaves using ZooKeeper.
- Support for Docker containers.
- Native isolation between tasks with Linux Terminals.
- Multi-resource scheduling (memory, CPU, disk and ports).
- Java, Python and C++ APIs for developing new parallel applications.
- Web UI for inspecting cluster state.

## About This Snapshot

Mesos is a flexible and highly configurable *distributed systems kernel* Cluster.

You can use several [execution frameworks](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/mesos-frameworks/) with it.

We're including [Marathon](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon) as the default framework installed on this snap. It's a cluster-wide init and control system [or PaaS layer] for services.

# Usage

- Spin up your Mesos master snapshot.
- Configure your cluster name using the startup script (see the terminal).
- Select the way to spin up your slave servers (automatic or manual).
- Access the Mesos status panel and the Marathon framework interface by clicking on the links provided.
