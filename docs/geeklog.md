## About Geeklog

**Geeklog** is an open source application for managing dynamic web content. It is written in PHP and supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MS SQL as the database backend.

"Out of the box", Geeklog is a CMS, or a blog engine with support for comments, trackbacks, multiple syndication formats, spam protection, and all the other vital features of such a system.

The core Geeklog distribution can easily be extended by the many community developed plugins and other add-ons to radically alter its functionality. Available plugins include forums, image galleries, and many more.
