## About SilverStripe
**SilverStripe**, create and manage your online experience with a user-friendly content management system; customise it with SilverStripe Framework, and enhance it with add-ons.

Built with the user in mind, SilverStripe CMS makes day-to-day content updates awesomely simple. Its flexibility makes SilverStripe CMS ideal for managing websites, intranets, and sophisticated web applications with stunning interactive design, and social and transactional features for your users.

We get it. Your website is unique and can’t be backed into a turnkey content management solution. That’s why we built SilverStripe Framework, a PHP web application framework that can be used standalone, or in harmony with the SilverStripe CMS. Modern best practices include object-oriented MVC/ORM architecture to cut the overhead associated with common programming tasks, and enable developers to quickly write and maintain code that powers complex web applications.

### Features
- *Developers, dig in.* - SilverStripe Framework gives developers the freedom to do what they do best—write great code in an elegant framework. SilverStripe developers enjoy building complex web applications quickly and robustly, without the limitations of a restrictive graphical user interface. Extend the functionality of your site with the Framework and add-ons.

- *Designers, stretch out.* - SilverStripe doesn’t impose any constraints or restrictions on the way your website should look or behave. With the code tucked away in the framework, website designers have full control over their HTML, CSS and JavaScript, allowing them to spend less time deciphering code and more time unleashing their creativity on the design of your user experience.

- *Open Source and free* - SilverStripe software is released under the [Open Source BSD license](http://www.silverstripe.org/software/framework/bsd-license/), and underpinned by public documentation, free code, and a developer community which you can join and interact with. It is based on open standards and technologies (HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript) and is platform-agnostic.

- *Scale up, scale out. Securely.* - Your data is sensitive and always growing. SilverStripe is architected to safeguard your data whether it be from malicious activity or inadvertent loss. With strong API integration points, caching, and support for multi-server cloud configurations, SilverStripe scales to high-volume workloads for content-rich and transactional sites.
