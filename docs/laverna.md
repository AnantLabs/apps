## About **Laverna*
Laverna is a JavaScript note-taking web application with a Markdown editor and encryption support.

It's built to be an **open source alternative to Evernote.**

The application stores all your notes in your browser local storage spaces such as indexedDB or localStorage, which is good for security reasons, because only you have access to them.

* Synchronizes with cloud storage services. At this time only Dropbox and RemoteStorage are supported
* Three editing modes: distraction free, preview, and normal mode
* WYSIWYG control buttons
* MathJax support
* Syntax highlighting

* Keybindings
