#GitLab Terminal.com Container
GitLab Community Edition (CE) is open source software to collaborate on code. 
Create projects and repositories, manage access and do code reviews. 
GitLab CE is on-premises software that you can install and use on your server(s).

###Usage:
This container has a GitLab instance auto-configurable and almost ready to use.

Just start your container machine from this snapshot, provide the URL and the GitLab will be configured automatically.


### Access:
After the auto-configuration is finished (shouldn't take more than 1 minute) you the access URL will be provided directly on the terminal console.

**Just copy and paste that URL in a new browser tab or window and start creating your GitLab repositories.**

### Note:
We recommend to use at least a *"mini"* or a *"small"* container for GitLab as you can experiment some **server timeouts** using *"micro"* containers.
