# **JRuby** Terminal.com Snapshot
*JRuby is a 100% Java implementation of the Ruby programming language.*

---

## About JRuby
**JRuby** is an implementation of the Ruby programming language atop the Java Virtual Machine, written largely in Java. It is free software released under a three-way EPL/GPL/LGPL license. JRuby is tightly integrated with Java to allow the embedding of the interpreter into any Java application with full two-way access between the Java and the Ruby code (similar to Jython for the Python language).

## About the JRuby Example
The JRuby example presented on this Terminal.com snapshot is based on the JRuby on Rails4 Sample App by [wizardbeard](https://github.com/wizardbeard) and it intends to show the code and the results of it after compiling that simple application.


---

## Usage
Just spin up your terminal container based on this snapshot and start using **JRuby**, as it's installed.
You can browse the source code of the sample application at /root/jruby_on_rails_sample_app and check it running by pressing on "Check the Jruby example here!"

Ruby, Jruby, NPM and RVM tools are installed to make your life easier when installing packages and dependences.
