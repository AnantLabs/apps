## Main Features

- **Easy publication** - Entries are written in a feature-rich editor allowing the user to add formatting to heir content. A wysiwyg - editor is also available and completes a toolbox designed for easy publication, so that you can fully focus on what you are writing.
- **Fully customizable theme** - You don't know what HTML and CSS are? Don't panic, you can customize the default theme online in - every aspect (colors, fonts, header image, etc.) without touching a single line of code. Customizing your site has never been so - easy.
- **User-friendly administration** - You should be able to write an entry quickly, without going through lengthy steps. The - administration interface is easy to use and designed with the users in mind, regardless of their levels, without compromising on the - functionality.
- **Media management** - You can add any kind of file to the media manager. The media manager will help you find your files when you - want to include them in an entry. You can also include music and video from external services (e.g. Youtube, Deezer, etc.), by - simply specifying the URL of the page that hosts the media to be included.
- **Flexible comment system** - As every entry can receive comments, Dotclear lets you disable comments on individual entries or at - the blog-level, with immediate effect or after the delay of your choice. You can naturally delete or modify comments.
- **Built-in antispam** - To protect your blog from comment and trackback spam, the standard installation is provided with many - filters and you can add more through plugins.
- **Localization** - Each user may choose the language in which the administration interface is displayed. Each blog can also be - displayed in any of the available languages. A language management tool lets you easily install and update languages in your - installation.
- **Presentation widgets** - The navigation elements of your blog can be customized through presentation widgets that you can place - where you want them to be displayed, so you have full control on your layout. You can also use widgets to display all kinds of - information (weather forecast, free text, rankings, etc.).
- **Themes and plugins** - You can install plugins to extend your blog's functionality, and themes to change its design. You will find - all those resources on Dotaddict.
- Pages - You can add pages that are independent from the entry flow, for example to add information about yourself, legal statements - or anything more fun.
- **Multiblog*** - A single Dotclear installation natively allows you to create as many blogs as you like, be it one, ten or - thousands, without requiring a third-party application.
- **Multi-user with permissions** - You might not be the only person managing your blog(s). That is why you can add as many users as - required and grant them permissions using a sophisticated permission management tool.
