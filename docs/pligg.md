## About Pligg

**Pligg CMS** enables you to create an online community where users can submit articles, vote on them, and leave comments. While most content management systems are designed for only a handful of authors, Pligg CMS was designed from the ground up as a way for a large number of contributors to submit and moderate content. Registered users, as well as visitors in some circumstances, are in control of the websiteâ€™s content.

## Main Features

- **Groups** - Allow users to share articles with other members who share a common interest in a topic.
- **Private Messaging** - A social network site isn't very social without the ability to communicate with each other.
- **Advanced Comment System** - Not only can you comment on articles, but you can rate comments posted by other users.
- **User Profiles** - Each user that signs up on a Pligg site gets their own profile page.
- **Module System** - Add additional functionality to your Pligg site without having to alter the Pligg code.
