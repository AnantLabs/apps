# Openface Dev Environment

This Terminal has a full Dev environment for Openface, installed over Ubuntu 14.04.
It also contains a full configured X11vnc and Guacamole server to let you connect to this
machine graphically just using your web browser. In the XFCE Desktop you will find the Comunity Edition of
[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/editions_comparison_matrix.html) and the Openface repository, ready
to be used.


## About XFCE:
**Xfce** is a lightweight desktop environment for UNIX-like operating systems. It aims to be fast and low on system resources, while still being visually appealing and user friendly.

## About Guacamole
**Guacamole** is a clientless remote desktop gateway. It supports standard protocols like VNC and RDP.
Thanks to HTML5, once Guacamole is installed on a server, all you need to access your desktops is a web browser.

# About PyCharm:
PyCharm is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for programming in Python. It provides code analysis, 
a graphical debugger, an integrated unit tester, integration with version control systems (VCSes), and supports 
web development with Django. PyCharm is developed by the Czech company JetBrains.

## About Openface
According its Github repository readme file, Openface is a Python and [Torch](http://torch.ch) implementation of the CVPR 2015 paper
[FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/app/1A_089.pdf)
by Florian Schroff, Dmitry Kalenichenko, and James Philbin at Google
using publicly available libraries and datasets.

- Password for vnc user: `t3rminal` (*sudo all* granted)

You can also share your desktop screen by opening the port 8080 on the "Share access menu" in this Terminal IDE.

As the web desktop interface is based in Guacamole, the clipboard exchange is managed using a clipboard text box, 
located on the Guacamole Interface. You can use it to copy and paste text between your own computer and the Terminal.
