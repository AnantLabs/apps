## About MODX Revolution
MODX Revolution (Revo) is an easy-to-use Content Management System (CMS) and Application Framework rolled into one. Despite the limitless possibilities that MODX affords you, we think you'll find it refreshingly intuitive to work with. At every step, MODX strives to deliver Creative Freedom.


### Features
- **For End-Users** - MODX offers you a system that lets you publish your offline content onto the web in any form, shape or presence you want. It also offers a completely customizable backend interface that you can make as simple (or as complex) as you like.
You can setup everything from a simple site, to a blog, to a full-scale web presence with MODX, and keep your admin interface simple and usable. Drag and drop your webpages around to reorder and move them. Get a full WYSIWYG view of your Resources. Leave Resources unpublished before you finish them. Schedule Resources to publish at certain times.
MODX helps you organize your content the way you want it, and get stellar built-in SEO results. MODX is fully, 100% Friendly URL compatible, so getting mysite.com/my/own/custom/url.html is incredibly simple, and as easy as structuring your site that way.

- **For Designers** - Ever wanted complete freedom with your HTML and CSS? Tired of hacking existing systems to get your design to work the way you comp'ed it? MODX does not generate one single line of HTML - it leaves the front-end design up to you.
You can use MODX as your Content Management System (CMS) of choice, as MODX offers completely flexible templating and no-holds-barred content delivery. Put your CSS and images where you want them. And once you're done designing, either hand off the development duties to your developer, or point-and-click install Extras straight from within the manager. Simple.

- **For Developers** - You've looked at different CMSes, but have found developing in them to be either a mishmash of too many unconnected code pieces, or simply not powerful or elegant enough. You've looked at PHP frameworks, and have found they have the power, but don't do Content Management nor have a good enough UI for your clients. You want the power and flexibility of a framework, with the UI and content management of a CMS.
Enter MODX Revolution. A completely flexible, powerful and robust API, built on OOP principles and using a PDO-powered Object Relational Model (ORM) called xPDO. Add in a rich, Sencha-powered UI for your clients, that's fully customizable. Custom properties and sets. Internationalization support. Package distribution built-in so you can pack up your code, and distribute it across any Revolution install. Add custom manager pages to run entire applications within MODX.
