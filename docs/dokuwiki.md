## About DokuWiki

DokuWiki is a simple to use and highly versatile Open Source [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wiki) software that doesn't require a database. It is loved by users for its clean and readable [syntax](https://www.dokuwiki.org/wiki:syntax). The ease of maintenance, backup and integration makes it an administrator's favorite. Built in [access controls](http://www.dokuwiki.org/acl) and authentication connectors make DokuWiki especially useful in the enterprise context and the large number of [plugins](http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins) contributed by its vibrant community allow for a broad range of use cases beyond a traditional wiki.
