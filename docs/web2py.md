## About web2py

**web2py** was inspired by Ruby on Rails. Same as Rails it focuses on rapid development and follows the Model View Controller design. Web2py differs from Rails by being based on Python (hence faster), by providing a comprehensive web-based IDE (thus there is no need to ever type shell commands unless you wish so) and by being able to run on the Google App Engine.

**Web2py** was also inspired by Django and as Django, it has the ability to generate forms from database tables and it includes an extensive set of validators. Web2py differs from Django by being more compact, easier to learn and by not having any project-level configuration files.

**Web2py** is less verbose than Java frameworks and its syntax is much cleaner than PHP frameworks. This makes applications simpler to develop and easier to read and maintain.

## Key Features

- **Batteries included** - Everything you need in one package including fast multi-threaded web server, SQL database and web-based interface. No third party dependencies but works with [third party tools](http://www.web2py.com/init/default/what).

- **Web-based IDE** - Create, modify, deploy and manage application from anywhere using your browser. One web2py instance can run multiple web sites using different databases.

- **Extensive docs** - Start with some [quick examples](http://www.web2py.com/init/default/examples), then read the [manual](http://www.web2py.com/book), watch [videos](http://vimeo.com/album/178500) and join the [user group](http://www.web2py.com/init/default/usergroups) for discussion.
